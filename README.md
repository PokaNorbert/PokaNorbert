-----------------------------------------------------------

I can describe myself as a person who always wants to succeed, being constantly motivated for this. I feed on victories in my career, and I quickly learn from defeats. 

Since last year I entered the IT field as a trainee, having at my base, before entering IT, quite a lot of experience in hardware and advanced knowledge of using electrical devices. The QA field attracted me the most, having the opinion that it suits me the most. I like to contribute to the quality of products and services used by people. I feel prepared to work full-time as a QA in this industry. 

Throughout my career, I have learned a lot, managing to acquire many skills. I like to learn a lot and feel like I am capable of accomplishing many activities. I like to receive challenges and new opportunities in my life. 

I don't want to talk/write too much, because there is a lot of work to do. 

If you have any questions to ask me, please contact me privately! I will respond as quickly as possible.
