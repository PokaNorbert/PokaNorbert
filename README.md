Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is POKA NORBERT
====================================================================================================================================

Junior QA Tester and Coordinator of Geftab (crypto project)
-----------------------------------------------------------

I am a highly motivated professional with a strong passion for continuous learning and growth. My journey in IT began last year as a trainee, allowing me to build a solid foundation in hardware expertise and advanced knowledge of electrical devices.

Through various training programs and self-learning initiatives, I discovered my passion for Quality Assurance (QA). This field enables me to thrive by applying my skills to improve the reliability and excellence of products and services. I am eager to contribute my expertise in problem-solving, process improvement, debugging, and testing to a dynamic team. Now, I am fully prepared to step into a full-time QA role and further develop my expertise.

Why choose me?¬†I embrace challenges, actively seek new opportunities, and consistently strive for excellence. To reinforce my knowledge, I recently achieved my ISTQB certification, which has given me deeper insights into the testing process and best practices.

If you'd like to connect or discuss potential opportunities, feel free to reach out. I‚Äôd love to explore how we can align our goals and values.
